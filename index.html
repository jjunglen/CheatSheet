            <p class="description">
                The RGB color scheme is convient because it's very close to how computers represent color internally. There's another another equally powerful system in CSS called the <span class="hsl">Hue-Saturation-Lightness</span> color scheme, abbreviated as HSL. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="overview">
            <p>
                The syntax for HSL is similar to the decimal form of RGB, though it differs important ways. The first number represets the degree of hue, and can be between 0 to 360. The second and third numbers are percentages, representing saturation, and lightness respectively.
            </p>
            <h2 class="example">color: hsl(30, 100%, 50%)</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="hue">
            <h2>Hue</h2>
            <p>
                Hue is the first number. It refers to an angle on a color wheel. <span class="red">Red is 0 degrees</span>, <span class="green">Green is at 120 degrees</span>, <span class="blue">Blue is 240 degrees</span>, and then back to <span class="red">Red at 360 degrees</span>. Review the color wheel below for more color degrees.

                <h3>Saturation</h3>
                <p>
                    Saturation refers to the intensity or purity of a color. The saturation is a percentage based, and as you increase to 100%, color become richer. As saturation decreases to 0%, colors come grayer.

            <div class="lightness-information">
                <h3>Lightness</h3>
                <p>
                    Lightness refers to the intensity or purity of the color. Halfway, or <em>50% is normal lightness</em>. Imagine a sliding dimmer on a lightswitch that starts half way. Slidig the dimmer up towards 100% makes the color lighter, closer to white. Sliding the dimmer down towards 0% makes the color darker, closer to black
